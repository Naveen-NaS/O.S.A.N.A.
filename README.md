Freemium Model:  We will offer a free basic version of O.S.A.N.A. with core functionalities. For advanced features like in-depth bias reports, historical analysis, or customized news feeds, users could subscribe to a premium tier.

API Monetization: Develop an open API that allows developers and businesses to integrate O.S.A.N.A.'s bias detection and news aggregation functionalities into their own applications or services. Charge a fee for access to the API based on usage..

We have trained a very accurate machine learning model which can predict with more than 95% accuracy whether the news scrapped realtime is genuine or false. To show the pridictive nature of our ML model I would like to show you the confusion matrix graph of our ml model.
